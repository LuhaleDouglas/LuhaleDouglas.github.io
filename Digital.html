        <h1>DIGITAL ELECTRONICS</h1>
         As electronic devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, digital circuits are becoming even more complex and smaller in size.
       	<h3>THE BASIC UNIT</h3>
       	The Basic Unit is the simplest “blackbox” (actually grey) in the experiment. It contains a single n-pn transistor, with three parallel inputs and two outputs. The circuit diagram is shown in<b> Figure 1.</b>
        Turn over the Basic Unit and identify the components. The “b”, “c” and “e” stand for the base,
        collector and emitter of the transistor, and since the emitter is connected to the 0 Volt reference level
        for both the input and output, this circuit is called a common emitter configuration.

       	In this section we investigate output voltage versus
        input voltage. Rather than using a second power
        supply for the input voltage, we use a potentiometer as
        in<b> Figure 2a.</b> Wire up the potentiometer circuit and
        use a voltmeter to investigate how it produces a
        variable voltage.

       	<b> Figure 2b</b> shows the circuit which can be
used to show the amplifying properties of
the transistor. Note that in this figure we
have not detailed the power supply. In
electronic circuit diagrams the power
supply is usually not shown, and we will
continue this convention; you may assume
that it is always there, however!

       	Wire the power supply to the left side of the Basic Unit, red-to-red and black-to-black, then turn the
system on. It is a good idea to keep the power supply on while you are wiring up your circuits. This
way you can monitor any short circuits that you may encounter. You may measure Vout for various
Vin by changing the potentiometer, paying particular attention to the range where Vout changes most
rapidly.
