	<p><h1>Introduction to Internet Technologies</h1><p>
		<br>
		<p> <h2>What is Internet</h2> 
			The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

		 	<h3>History of the internet </h3>
		 	   The Internet as we know it may not have taken shape until the 1990s, well after Bill Gates revealed his first PC. So who invented the Internet? The timeline of the Internet actually traces all the way back to the Vietnam War era: 1969, to be exact. In that year, a team of defense engineers at the University of Los Angeles-California (UCLA) sent the first-ever instant message via computer to another team thousands of miles away at Stanford University. From their work station in 3420 Boelter Hall, on the UCLA campus, the defense engineers had just set up the first node of Arpanet, a system funded by the Department of Defense’s Advance Research Projects Agency (ARPA). ARPA’s vision was for a system that would connect large computers at the Department of Defense’s various facilities so that they could share software, information, and storage space. UCLA would be one of its four main hubs—the University of Utah, SRI International, and UC-Santa Barbara would be the others. In its short history the Internet has rapidly evolved from this simple, four-hub, military-only data grid to a planet-wide, universally accessed and accessible informational universe that we know and love today. But let’s face it: In history of information technology, a lot can happen in 44 years. Let’s take a look at a simple history of the Internet and recap some of the milestones that got us from there to here with a short Internet history timeline:
		 	   <ul><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1974.</b> The word “Internet” first appeared in print—in a DARPA-published Request for Comments document on TCP/IP, a new set of communications and networking protocols for managing data transmissions on the new system. TCP/IP is still integral to the present-day Internet. In the meantime, Arpanet was growing fast as more universities, science centers, and army installations got connected. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1976.</b> Queen Elizabeth of England became the first head of state to send an email. Jimmy Carter followed suit and used email several times while campaigning. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1983.</b> The Domain Name System (DNS) was invented. Whereas site’s names had been obtuse sequences of letters and numbers, they would now be easyto-remember names with endings such as .gov, .edu, or .mil. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1985.</b> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded construction of Arpanet’s biggest upgrade yet: the NSFNET, a command hub of five supercomputers to serve as highways for all data traffic. NSFNET could transmit data at 56 kilobits per second—slower than some present-day modems.</li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1990.</b> Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML and a text browser, as well as a hypertext graphical user interface (GUI) browser. Then he established the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol client and a server via the Internet. These inventions, put together, were the makings of Web pages as we know them today. Lee also made up the term “World Wide Web.” The synonym Information Superhighway would follow in a few more years.</li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1991.</b> The NSF allowed commercial enterprises to use the Internet for the first time. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b> 1994.</b> Jeff Bezos founded Amazon. A whole new world of e-commerce was born. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>1995.</b> The NSF ceased funding the Internet altogether, leaving it a completely self-sustaining industry. Also noteworthy, Sun Microsystems first released Java, still an immensely popular Internet programming language to this day</li><br>
		 	   	<li>1998. Google opened its first office. </li><br>
		 	   	<li><b>2004-2005.</b> Facebook was launched in December 2004. YouTube debuted the next year. The social-media revolution had begun. </li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2006.</b> Google CEO Eric Schmidt introduced the term “cloud computing” at an industry conference. “The Cloud” would become another synonym for the Internet soon thereafter. </li>
		 	   	<li><b>2007.</b> Mobile and smartphones technologies going commercial and growing rapidly. Consumers would no longer need a personal computer to go online. The Internet would be reachable wherever they could find a wireless signal. </li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2008.</b> Google Index reaches 1 trillion URLs. Google launched Chrome. Spotify launched. Apple launched App Store. Dozens of space images are transmitted to and from a Nasa science spacecraft located more than 32 million km from Earth.</li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2009.</b> Mobile data traffic exceeded voice traffic every single month. Globally, mobile data exceeded an exabyte (a billion gigabytes) for the first time. Foursquare launched – users start “check in” at locations all over the world. Kichstarter is founded in April: crowdfunding becomes popular with startups.</li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2010.</b> The number of registered domains reaches 200 million. Apple launches iPad, many other producers followed. 4G wireless networks launches in US. Instagram and Pinterest launched. Astronaut T.J. Creamer uploads the first tweet from space. </li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2012.</b> Worldwide internet users breaks 2.4 billion</li><br>
		 	   	<li> <b>2013 – 2015.</b> More data was produced than throughout all human history. Apple releases Apple Watch, other producers followed – smart watches industry was created. Google releases Google Glasses. Microsoft announces the mercy killing of Internet Explorer. Mobile Internet surpasses desktop. Almost a half of the world’s populations become Internet users. Superfast Gigablast Internet (100 times faster then DSL) is introduced to residential customers. </li><br>
		 	   </ul>

		 	<h2>Extranet</h2> <br> 
		 	Extranet refers to network within an organization, using internet to connect to the outsiders in controlled manner. It helps to connect businesses with their customers and suppliers and therefore allows working in a collaborative manner. 

		 	<h3>Benefits of Extranet</h3> <br> 
		 	 Extranet proves to be a successful model for all kind of businesses whether small or big. Here are some of the advantages of extranet for employees, suppliers, business partners, and customers:

		 	<h3>Extranet Issues</h3> <br> 
		 	Apart for advantages there are also some issues associated with extranet. These issues are discussed below: 

		 	<h4>Hosting</h4> <br> 

		 	Where the extranet pages will be held i.e. who will host the extranet pages. In this context there are two choices: <br> 

            Host it on your own server. <br> 


            Host it with an Internet Service Provider ISP in the same way as web pages. But hosting extranet pages on your own server requires high bandwidth internet connection which is very costly. 

            <h4>Security</h4> <br> 

            Additional firewall security is required if you host extranet pages on your own server which result in a complex security mechanism and increase work load. 

             <h4>Accessing Issues</h4> <br> 

             Information can not be accessed without internet connection. However, information can be accessed in Intranet without internet connection.

             <h4>Decreased Interaction</h4> <br> 

             It decreases the face to face interaction in the business which results in lack of communication among customers, business partners and suppliers.

		 	<h3>Extranet vs. Intranet</h3> <br> 
		 	The following table shows differences between Extranet and Intranet: 
		 	<table border="1" cellpadding="20">
		 		<tr>
		 			<th>EXTRANET</th>
		 			<th>INTRANET</th>
		 		</tr>
		 		<tr>
		 			<td>Internal network that can be accessed externally. </td>
		 			<td>Internal network that can not be accessed externally</td>
		 		</tr>
		 		<tr>
		 			<td>Extranet is extension of company's Intranet. </td>
		 			<td>Only limited users of a company. </td>
		 		</tr>
		 		<tr>
		 			<td>For limited external communication between customers, suppliers and business partners. </td>
		 			<td> 
                    Only for communication within a company. </td>
		 		</tr>
		 	</table>
